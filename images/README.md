# Images Directory

This directory contains static image assets for the MCPokemon project.

## Purpose

The images directory serves as a central repository for:

- **Reference Images**: Screenshots and visual references for the image recognition system
- **Game State Documentation**: Visual documentation of different Pokemon Red game states
- **Training Data**: Images used for training and testing the AI's visual recognition capabilities
- **Debug Screenshots**: Screenshots captured during gameplay for debugging and analysis

## Organization

Images should be organized into logical subdirectories based on their purpose and content type.

## Usage

These images support the MCPokemon MCP server's image recognition capabilities, helping the AI understand and navigate the Pokemon Red game environment.
