# Decision Path Templates

Templates for step-by-step planned moves with timing.

## Purpose

Decision path templates help the LLM plan and execute sequences of moves:

- Step-by-step action sequences
- Timing intervals (e.g., 0.25-second spacing)
- Move combinations and patterns
- Input sequences (directional moves, button presses)
- Conditional logic for different scenarios

## Template Structure

Decision path prompts should provide clear, executable action sequences with appropriate timing.

## Usage

These templates support the fourth stage of the 5-stage narration process, translating high-level goals into specific input sequences.
