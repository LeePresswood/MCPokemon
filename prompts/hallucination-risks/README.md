# Hallucination Risks Templates

Templates for explicit notes on uncertain assumptions.

## Purpose

Hallucination risk templates help the LLM identify and acknowledge uncertainty:

- Assumptions about game state
- Uncertain visual interpretations
- Potential knowledge gaps
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Alternative scenarios to consider

## Template Structure

Hallucination risk prompts should explicitly state assumptions and potential failure modes.

## Usage

These templates support the fifth stage of the 5-stage narration process, helping identify when reasoning may diverge from ground truth.
