# Knowledge Injection Templates

Templates for overlaying canonical knowledge from Pokémon Red and related sources.

## Purpose

Knowledge injection templates help ground the LLM's reasoning with accurate information:

- Game mechanics and rules
- Map layouts and locations
- NPC behaviors and dialog
- Item locations and effects
- Pokémon data and movesets

## Template Structure

Knowledge injection prompts should provide factual, canonical information that corrects or supplements the LLM's base knowledge.

## Usage

These templates support the second stage of the 5-stage narration process, helping prevent hallucinations by injecting verified game knowledge.
