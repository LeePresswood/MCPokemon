# Perception Templates

Templates for describing what is visible in the current game state.

## Purpose

Perception templates help the LLM consistently describe visual elements including:

- Bounding boxes and object positions
- Sprites and characters
- UI elements and menus
- Map features and landmarks
- Current player position

## Template Structure

Perception prompts should focus on objective observations without interpretation or assumptions.

## Usage

These templates support the first stage of the 5-stage narration process for debugging LLM reasoning and identifying hallucinations.
