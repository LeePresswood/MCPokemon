# Post-Movement Templates

Templates for analyzing results after executing planned moves.

## Purpose

Post-movement templates help the LLM evaluate the success of executed actions:

- Comparison of expected vs. actual outcomes
- Progress toward short-term and long-term goals
- Error detection and identification
- Backtracking strategies
- State transition analysis
- Success/failure assessment

## Template Structure

Post-movement prompts should compare previous game state (State 1) with new game state (State 2) and identify any discrepancies.

## Usage

These templates support post-movement analysis, enabling the LLM to detect errors and decide whether to continue or backtrack to correct mistakes.
