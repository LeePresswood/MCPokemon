After executing a planned sequence of moves, the LLM performs a post-movement analysis to determine if progress was made toward the short-term or long-term goals. This involves comparing the previous game state (State 1) with the new game state (State 2) and identifying any discrepancies or errors. If necessary, the LLM can decide to backtrack partially or fully to correct mistakes.
