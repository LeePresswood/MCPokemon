# Task Framing Templates

Templates for defining current subgoals and objectives.

## Purpose

Task framing templates help the LLM maintain focus on specific objectives:

- Short-term goals (immediate actions)
- Long-term goals (overall progression)
- Context for decision making
- Priority and urgency levels
- Success criteria

## Template Structure

Task framing prompts should clearly state the current objective and how it relates to broader goals.

## Usage

These templates support the third stage of the 5-stage narration process, ensuring the LLM maintains clear focus on defined objectives.
